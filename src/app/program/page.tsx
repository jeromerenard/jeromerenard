        <p className="">
          Hey, Jerome here. <br />
          This year I decided to bring back this workshop I do every other year.{" "}
          <br />
          It's an opportunity for me to share my experience & knowledge and
          hopefully help you the same way my mentors helped me devlop my skills.{" "}
          <br />
          It's important for me that you are motivated and willing to put the
          time in it to get better. <br />
          What I'll be teaching you, explaining you or showing you in only one
          part of the process. <br />
          The magic is going to come from you practicing with sessions I will
          give you, work you're doing with others artists, or your own music.{" "}
          <br />
          I will take the time to give you as much advice as I got when I was
          younger. <br />
          My goal is to help any artists or producers who want to a deeper
          understanding of mixing so they have the freedom to get better songs
          out and build a bigger fanbase till they decide (or not) to add other
          members to their team (like me as a mixer :) ) <br />
          Below are the overall info about the program. I run it over 3 months
          for a specific reason. <br />
          It allows us to go over the basis, and then go into more detail with
          each session. <br />
          You'll get from me 2 sessions from major artists you can practice to
          mix.
        </p>
